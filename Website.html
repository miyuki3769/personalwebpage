    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>Hello! My name is Miyuki3769. I am Senior in high school.<br> I like to consider myself as a Hobbyist Digital Artist and a Beginner at Computer Programming.</p>
    <p>Most of all I see myself as your average Otaku who absolutely loves anime!<br> I dream of going to a ComicCon one day and visiting Japan.</p>
    <p> I have created this website mostly for myself to keep up with all of the animes that I have ever watched and the manga that I have read.<br>However, once I get this website fully set up I might start making my own reviews on some of them and let viewers
        like you comment and give your own opinions!</p>
    <p>Watch me on <a href="http://miyuki3769.deviantart.com">Deviantart</a> or subscribe to my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoElHIL1t1itG-3oZw7UImg">Youtube</a> channel!</p>
